To build and install Hamsolar.
You need Qt 4.2 or newer.

In the hamsolar directory...
$ qmake
$ make

That should give you an executable called hamsolar.
As root, copy hamsolar to /usr/bin.
Or on Ubuntu:
sudo cp ./hamsolar /usr/bin

Or if you see this message on Ubuntu:
$./hamsolar
Bus::open: Can not get ibus-daemon's address.
IBusInputContext::createInputContext: no connection to ibus-daemon
$

You could ignore it but I hate warning message spam. You can start iBus via:
System => Preferences => iBus Preferences
When you open it if it is not running it asks if you want to run it.  Say yes.
(I am running Gnome)
IBus is an intelligent input bus for Linux/Unix.
